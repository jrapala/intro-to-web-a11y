					<h6>What is Accessibility?</h6>
					<br/>
					<p class="fragment fade-in text-left">A measure of how simply a person can participate in an activity.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						I like this definition.

						it's a measure of how simple a person can participate in an activity.

						So, an accessible product is a product that can be used by anyone, regardless of ability.

					<h6>Accessibility vs Inclusive Design</h6>
					<br/>
					<img style="max-width: 450px" src="./images/diversity.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						When people think of designing for accessibility they may often think of inclusive design.

						Inclusive design is creating designs that take into account personal identifiers such as ability, race, economic status,
						language, age, and gender. 

						Inclusive designs help everyone feel welcome to use a product.

						Accessibility, in how I refer to it, is a subset of inclusive design.
						It's making product available to people no matter what their ability.

					<h6>Types of Disabilities</h6>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">Visual</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">Hearing</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">Motor</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">Cognitive</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						What are some type of disabilities?

						There are visual disabilities such as blindness, color blindness, or just low vision in general

						The are hearing disabilities such as being deaf or hard of Hearing

						There are motor disabilities that can prevent people from using tools like mice or keyboards

						There are also cognitive disabilities that can prevent people from reading long strings of text 
						or prevent them from reading text using certain types of fonts

					<h6>Permanent vs Temporary vs Situational Disabilities</h6>

						<img style="max-width: 450px" src="./images/rolling-pin.jpeg"/>
						<img style="max-height: 500px" src="./images/types-of-disabilities.jpeg"/>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						When you think of disabilities you may think they are permanent.
						However that is not true. They can be temporary or situational as well.

						That's a rolling pin.
						You need two hands to use it.
						However some people however may not have two hands to use.
						This can be due to something like a permanent injury where they only have one arm.
						Or they have broken an arm and currently only have use of one hand.
						Or they may be holding on to something, like a baby, and can only use one hand at the moment.

						This applies to all sorts of abilities.
						Another example regards hearing. 
						You may be born deaf. 
						Or you may have an ear infection and can't hear as well.
						Or you may be at a loud concert and can't hear what the person next to you is trying to tell you.

					<h6>Accessible ≠ Usable</h6>
					<div class="fragment fade-in"><img style="max-width: 450px" src="./images/phone-number.gif"/></div>
					<aside class="notes">
						It's also important to know that something that is accessible doesn't necessarily mean that it's usable.
						We've all see our fair share of really bad UX.
						Sure, you can enter your phone number this way, but it's going to be a really awful experience and you're probably just going to give up.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h6>Alt Tags</h6>
					<img src="./images/fender-support.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						Here's an example of accessible images creating a poor user experience.
						When a person that is sight impaired uses the screen reader VoiceOver to navigate this support page, 
						they'll find that the images use alt tags, which allows the screen reader to read a description of an image.

						However when they navigate to this image, the screen reader will read out "Snip 2 0 2 0 0 9 0 1 underscore 6 8 dot p n g image"
						That's not very useful. And it can also get really annoying.
						A better alt tag would be "A screenshot of navigating to Collections, as explained on the page"
					</aside>

				<section>
					<h6>Skip Links</h6>
					<img src="./images/nytimes.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						When you think about usability for people with disabilities, you can add helpful features such as skip links.
						Skip links are a way to improve the navigation experience for users that use screen readers or keyboards.
						Here is an example of a skip link from the New York Times.
						It's only visible to keyboard and screen reader users and allows you to skip stepping through all of the navigation that's on top and go directly to the page content

					<h6>So Why Does Accessibility Matter?</h6>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">It's the right thing to do.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">It makes everyone's life easier.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">It's good for SEO.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">It'll keep you from getting sued.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">It's great for business.</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						So why does all of this stuff I'm talking about even matter?
						There are a number of reasons.

						First, it's the right thing to do. You shouldn't exclude people from using your products.

						It also makes everyone's life easier.
						If you are designing for people with disabilities, then you are creating
						intuitive and efficient content that is easy for everyone to use.
						And then if a user experiences a change in their abilities, they can continue to use your product.

						It's good for SEO.
						Using semantic HTML and things like video and audio transcripts give you a big SEO bump.

						It'll keep your from getting sued.
						Failure to comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines can and have resulted in lawsuits.
						In 2020, there were over 10,000 ADA Title III lawsuits filed in U.S. federal courts.

						It's great for business.
						You reach more people. SO many people have disabilities. This is your chance to reach them.
						And people like to use sites that 

						In 2018, Accenture Strategy surveyed 30,000 consumers and found that 62% of consumers prefer to make purchases
						from brands that are willing to take a stand on issues that matter. 
						And 47% are willing to walk away if they are disappointed with a company's actions.
