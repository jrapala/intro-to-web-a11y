					<p class="fragment fade-in text-left">A measure of how simply a person can participate in an activity.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						I like this definition.

						it's a measure of how simple a person can participate in an activity.

						So, an accessible product is a product that can be used by anyone, regardless of ability.

					<h6>Accessibility vs Inclusive Design</h6>
					<br/>
					<img style="max-width: 450px" src="./images/diversity.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						When people think of designing for accessibility they may often think of inclusive design.

						Inclusive design is creating designs that take into account personal identifiers such as ability, race, economic status,
						language, age, and gender. 

						Inclusive designs help everyone feel welcome to use a product.

						Accessibility, in how I refer to it, is a subset of inclusive design.
						It's making product available to people no matter what their ability.

						What are some type of disabilities?

						There are visual disabilities such as blindness, color blindness, or just low vision in general

						The are hearing disabilities such as being deaf or hard of Hearing

						There are motor disabilities that can prevent people from using tools like mice or keyboards

						There are also cognitive disabilities that can prevent people from reading long strings of text 
						or prevent them from reading text using certain types of fonts

					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						When you think of disabilities you may think they are permanent.
						However that is not true. They can be temporary or situational as well.

						That's a rolling pin.
						You need two hands to use it.
						However some people however may not have two hands to use.
						This can be due to something like a permanent injury where they only have one arm.
						Or they have broken an arm and currently only have use of one hand.
						Or they may be holding on to something, like a baby, and can only use one hand at the moment.

						This applies to all sorts of abilities.
						Another example regards hearing. 
						You may be born deaf. 
						Or you may have an ear infection and can't hear as well.
						Or you may be at a loud concert and can't hear what the person next to you is trying to tell you.

					<h6>How Do We Build Accessible Applications?</h6>
					<aside class="notes">
					So the tools exist that let humans interact with the web and applications.
					However we as developers need to build things correctly so they can support these assistive devices.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h6>Building Accessible Web Applications</h6>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">Semantic HTML</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">Keyboard support</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">ARIA</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						How do we do this on the web?
						The easiest thing you can do is use Semantic HTML.
						It's using tags like section, article, header, nav, p, and headings to reinforce the meaning
						of information on a page.
						Screen readers know what to do with semantic HTML.
						If you use a div for everything, the screen reader won't know what to do.

						Earlier I mentioned that 19% of adult have difficulties with mobility
						If you think about it, a mouse is a fairly difficult thing to use. It requires pretty fine motor control. 
						Many people cannot use mice. They use keyboards, foot pedals, and other assistive devices instead.
						Browsers have keyboard listeners that let you navigate a page with one.
						We need to make sure we don't turn off focus styles that let a user where their current location is.

						ARIA is an API that allows you add accessibility support to your HTML.
						It stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications
						Using semantic HTML can get you really far, however the designs that are implemented may need
						extra help from ARIA is order to accurately communicate how a user can interact with a screen.

						A simple example is a toggle icon button, like the Favorite heart buttons we have in the Play app.
						You can visually recognize if a lesson is favorited by the color of the icon. What happens if you cannot
						see the icon though? Then you need to add support with an attribute like aria-pressed, which is a boolean
						that tells you if a button is toggled or not.

					<aside class="notes">
						Similar to semantic HTML, a lot of accessibility comes for free when building native mobile applications.
						However accessibility APIs exist for both iOS and Android to fill in the gaps.
						These APIs can be accessed in whatever way you want to build apps.

					<h6>üéâ Easy Accessibility Wins üéâ</h6>
					<br/>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">Use semantic HTML</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">Use your keyboard</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">Use a contrast checker <img id="contrast-image" src="/images/contrast.png"/></li>

						<li class="fragment fade-in">Run a Lighthouse audit</li>
					</ol>
					<aside class="notes">
						When we build applications as developers, we tend to build for people that have the same abilities that we do.
						Instead we should start thinking about the other ways people interact with applications.
						One way to start this shift is to keep a list of easy accessibility wins in the back of your head as you develop.
						These are simple checks that don't require turning on the screen reader and can help prevent accessibility bugs before they
						spiral out of control.

						1. Use semantic HTML. If it's a button, use the button tag. Don't use the div tag. It's not a div, it's a button.
						2. Use your keyboard. If you build a new feature, and it's interactive, make your sure you can get there with a keyboard.
						And make sure there's a visual feedback to show you where you are on the screen.
						3. Use a contrast checker. This is built into almost all browser dev tools. Xcode also has one.
						Make sure the contrast ratio of text to background is at least 4.5:1
						3. Describe your images. Add an description or hide it from a screen reader if it's decorative. 
						4. Adding a focus style? Target hover as well. The style should apply to both.
						5. If you're using Chrome, run a quick Lighthouse audit. It won't find all of the issues, but it will highlight
						a lot that can be easily fixed

					<aside class="notes">
						It's also important to know that something that is accessible doesn't necessarily mean that it's usable.
						We've all see our fair share of really bad UX.
						Sure, you can enter your phone number this way, but it's going to be a really awful experience and you're probably just going to give up.

				<section>
					<h6>Alt Tags</h6>
					<img src="./images/fender-support.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						Here's an example of accessible images creating a poor user experience.
						When a person that is sight impaired uses the screen reader VoiceOver to navigate this support page, 
						they'll find that the images use alt tags, which allows the screen reader to read a description of an image.

						However when they navigate to this image, the screen reader will read out "Snip 2 0 2 0 0 9 0 1 underscore 6 8 dot p n g image"
						That's not very useful. And it can also get really annoying.
						A better alt tag would be "A screenshot of navigating to Collections, as explained on the page"

				<section>
					<h6>Skip Links</h6>
					<img src="./images/nytimes.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						When you think about usability for people with disabilities, you can add helpful features such as skip links.
						Skip links are a way to improve the navigation experience for users that use screen readers or keyboards.
						Here is an example of a skip link from the New York Times.
						It's only visible to keyboard and screen reader users and allows you to skip stepping through all of the navigation that's on top and go directly to the page content

					<h6>So Why Does Accessibility Matter?</h6>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">It's the right thing to do.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">It makes everyone's life easier.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">It's good for SEO.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">It'll keep you from getting sued.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">It's great for business.</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						So why does all of this stuff I'm talking about even matter?
						There are a number of reasons.

						First, it's the right thing to do. You shouldn't exclude people from using your products.

						It also makes everyone's life easier.
						If you are designing for people with disabilities, then you are creating
						intuitive and efficient content that is easy for everyone to use.
						And then if a user experiences a change in their abilities, they can continue to use your product.

						It's good for SEO.
						Using semantic HTML and things like video and audio transcripts give you a big SEO bump.

						It'll keep your from getting sued.
						Failure to comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines can and have resulted in lawsuits.
						In 2020, there were over 10,000 ADA Title III lawsuits filed in U.S. federal courts.

						It's great for business.
						You reach more people. SO many people have disabilities. This is your chance to reach them.
						And people like to use sites that 

						In 2018, Accenture Strategy surveyed 30,000 consumers and found that 62% of consumers prefer to make purchases
						from brands that are willing to take a stand on issues that matter. 
						And 47% are willing to walk away if they are disappointed with a company's actions.
